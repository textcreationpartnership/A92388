            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <l>In Christ is rest as I shall find,</l>
                  <l>If I upon him set my mind,</l>
                  <l>For he shews mercy unto all,</l>
                  <l>Therefore upon him will I call.</l>
                  <l>O mercy Lord, mercy to me,</l>
                  <l>That Christ my dwelling place may be:</l>
                  <l>Then shall my soul ravished be,</l>
                  <l>And sing Hallelujahs unto thee.</l>
                  <l>Christ is a pattern of patience pure,</l>
                  <l>And those that trust in him are sure;</l>
                  <l>Though Satan seeks souls to devour,</l>
                  <l>Yet Christ is of Almighty power.</l>
                  <l>Then let us all on him depend,</l>
                  <l>That we may make a Godly end:</l>
                  <l>That then our souls to heaven may flie,</l>
                  <l>Where we shall live, and never die.</l>
                  <l>In this world is but filthy drosse,</l>
                  <l>Which at the last will prove a crosse;</l>
                  <l>If we in it do live in sin,</l>
                  <l>It had better we had never bin.</l>
                  <l>Come quickly, Lord, and do not stay,</l>
                  <l>That I from sin may turn away;</l>
                  <l>For sin is loathsome unto thee,</l>
                  <l>Lord grant it may be the same to me.</l>
                  <l>Lord, teach us all to put on Christ,</l>
                  <l>Who hath bought us at so dear a price;</l>
                  <l>For where thou puttest that garment on,</l>
                  <l>It makes them glorious like the Sun.</l>

                  <l>Out of this world I soon must go,</l>
                  <l>Therefore in grace teach me to grow,</l>
                  <l>That at the last I fit may be</l>
                  <l>To dwell in Heaven still with Thee.</l>
                  <l>Oh Lord, let me in Christ be found,</l>
                  <l>Let heaven in my heart abound;</l>
                  <l>That death may not a terrour be,</l>
                  <l>But as a welcome guest to me.</l>
                  <l>Oh Lord of Hosts, send down thy Spirit,</l>
                  <l>That I thy pretious Son inherit.</l>
                  <l>For in thee is everlasting rest,</l>
                  <l>And righteousness doth please thee best.</l>
                  <l>Teach me, O Lord, while I am young,</l>
                  <l>Out of the Divels claws to run;</l>
                  <l>Least he be grafted in my heart,</l>
                  <l>And from me will not soon depart.</l>
                  <l>Now let us look what things are done,</l>
                  <l>And consider how fast our glasse doth run;</l>
                  <l>Time calls for grace, but we have none,</l>
                  <l>Therefore from sin let us return.</l>
                  <l>Let us pray to God with all our hearts,</l>
                  <l>And he will surely take our parts:</l>
                  <l>Here we may see hee's full of love,</l>
                  <l>And love proceedeth from above.</l>
                  <l>Oh let us now return from sin,</l>
                  <l>Which hath so much our enemy been;</l>
                  <l>And unto Hell it will us bring,</l>
                  <l>If wee will not obey our King.</l>
                  <l>GOD is the King of Kings, I say,</l>
                  <l>And will preserve us night and day,</l>
                  <l>If we will live in fear of him,</l>
                  <l>And suddenly forsake our sin.</l>
                  <l>The Divel tempts and tries his skill,</l>
                  <l>And full of sin our hearts doth fill:</l>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:168510:4"/>
                  <l>But yet there is a God above,</l>

                  <l>This world is passing quite away,</l>
                  <l>Therefore we cannot look to stay:</l>
                  <l>Let us solemnly consider it,</l>
                  <l>Least we fall down into the pit.</l>
                  <l>This Pit which I do you of tell,</l>
                  <l>It is a cursed place call'd Hell:</l>
